# NeuralNet
Neural network to classify diabetes data.

Neural network with 2 hidden layers and 10 hidden neurons per hidden layer. Uses sigmoid activation function and cross entropy loss function for binary classification of diabetes dataset. Math for backpropagation based off of partial differential equations in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation.

Best measured accuracy of 83% on testing data (diabetes dataset split into 20% testing data, 80% training data).
